## üåü Features
- **Dual AI Models**: Uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for both **mammography** and **ultrasound** image analysis.
- **Tumor Segmentation**: Employs the U-Net architecture and YOLOv8x for tumor segmentation in medical images.
- **Tumor Classification**: Utilizes a custom CNN to classify tumors as benign or malignant.
- **Data Augmentation**: Uses GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) for synthetic image generation to augment ultrasound data.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Provides results for classification and segmentation within seconds on mobile devices.
- **Integrated into Android**: The app allows users to upload medical images from their devices and instantly get predictions.
- **Offline and Online Support**: Capable of functioning both offline and synchronizing with the Flask backend server when online.

## üìä AI Models and Technologies
- **YOLOv8x** for instance segmentation of mammograms.
- **U-Net Architecture** for ultrasound tumor segmentation.
- **CNN Model** for the classification of both mammograms and ultrasounds.
- **Flask API** serving as the backend for data processing and model inference.


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Upload Medical Image**: The user uploads a mammogram or ultrasound image via the Android app.
2. **AI Analysis**: The app preprocesses the image and sends it to the Flask server for segmentation and classification using AI models.
3. **Result Visualization**: The results, including tumor masks and bounding boxes, are displayed to the user.

## üîç Key Contributions
- **Innovative Dual System**: Combines both segmentation and classification in one app for mammograms and ultrasounds.
- **Pectoral Muscle Removal**: Investigated the impact of pectoral muscle removal on mammogram image analysis.
- **End-to-End System**: Developed a comprehensive end-to-end solution with a seamless user interface for both professionals and general users.
